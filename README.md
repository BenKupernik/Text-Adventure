This is the final project for my introduction to Python class from 2019 when I first started to take classes in computer science. Itâ€™s a text based adventure game where the user gets to make a few choices and discover some treasure! I have it here because it's fun to show friends and sometimes it's nice to look back at something you wrote a long time ago and see how much you've learned since then.
